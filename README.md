# GameIGuess

GameIGuess is a simple little game im working on. It is written in rust using the miniquad library. Miniquad provides an easy to use but low level OpenGL context.

## Vision

I want this game to be a sandbox survival game, with procedurally generated landscapes. There would have building mechanics that take inspiration from Fortnite, Garrys Mod & Minecraft. Players would be able to place individual pieces of wood, stone, metal and glass to make houses and bases out of that.

## Features I want in the game (not yet implemented)

- Procedurally generated landscapes
- Building with materials such as wood, stone, metal or glass
- Players being able to place individual pieces of material to create something big
- Multiplayer
